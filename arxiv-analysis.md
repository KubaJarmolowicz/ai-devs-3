## Wstęp

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** Time travel, long considered a realm of literary fiction and science fiction, has been seen as impossible due to the laws of physics. However, recent research into the properties of antimatter has introduced a promising new aspect to this seemingly closed discussion. Antimatter, which has been extensively studied in the last decade, reveals properties that allow for the alteration of the structure of space-time, leading scientists to conclusions that were previously only hypothetical. The existence of quantum space-time tunnels could enable the transmission of information particles - and in a more advanced form also matter - to earlier moments in history, opening up previously unknown possibilities in the field of temporal travel.

The key importance of such technologies lies in their potential impact on the future of our planet. The use of time travel to modify critical moments in history could be a real tool for repairing the damage that humanity has done to the environment. In the face of global crises such as melting glaciers, an expanding ozone hole, and dramatic climate changes, the need for action is more urgent than ever. If time travel proves possible, it could be used to correct decisions that have irreversibly changed the ecosystem.

However, such intervention carries the risk of time paradoxes and consequences that could be as dangerous as leaving things to their own devices. Nonetheless, the idea of time travel, which until recently seemed a pure abstraction, is now taking on real shapes. If ways of neutralizing these threats could be developed, we could think about space-time "interventions" that would restore ecological balance on a global level.

## Ograniczenia technologiczne i wczesne testy

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** Current technology, although opening new possibilities, imposes significant limitations on the practical application of time travel. Sending information to the past is technically feasible only within about 200-240 years due to the complexity of antimatter interactions with spacetime. Time jumps larger than this range lead to disruptions in transmission stability, preventing precise delivery of information to the intended point in history. Moreover, trips to the future, even theoretically already occurred, are completely unattainable as we lack technology capable of reversing entropy at the molecular level. This means that a person "moving" to the past will most likely never return to their original reality, as our devices do not allow for precise reconstruction of such a trajectory in time. However, it is possible to make several consecutive "jumps" within the mentioned time range, opening the theoretical possibility of multi-stage transmissions between specific points in history, thereby increasing the time range of the jump. All of this remains hypothetical. So far, experiments, including one recently conducted by my team, have only allowed for the transmission of 128 bits of data, which registered on our computers 42 minutes before the experiment began. The data transmission showed unprecedented stability and precision - only one bit of information was disrupted during transmission. Although this is a small step, the stability of transmission within such a short time window suggests that larger operations may be feasible in the future, albeit with the mentioned temporal limitations.

## Przesył danych multimedialnych

**Content Type:** image
**Analysis:** In one of their most spectacular tests, a team of researchers managed to send a photographic image back in time with exceptional accuracy and data stability. The experiment took place in a market, where a monochromatic photo of a sunset was taken at 19:42. The city is most likely Kraków, Poland. Using advanced temporal transmission technology, the data was processed and saved on a memory card with a time reading of 16:08 on the same day, over three hours before the photo was actually taken. Despite precise calibration and signal strengthening, the image suffered minor damage, revealing small disturbances and artifacts visible on the right side of the photo. This result indicates the growing potential of transmitting complex data in time, but also reveals challenges related to maintaining the integrity of the message, which is a key area for further research on more complex materials. The original image shows a black and white street scene with people and pigeons on a cobblestone square, buildings silhouetted against a cloudy sunset sky, and a group of birds flying in the sky.

## Próby transmisji materii

**Content Type:** image
**Analysis:** The text discusses an ambitious experiment involving the transmission of matter, in this case, a fruit. Although the transmission seemed successful, upon closer examination, it was found that the fruit arrived without its seeds, which disappeared during the process. The seeds were never found, suggesting that the transmission still needs improvement to ensure the full integrity of the transmitted objects. The image captions indicate the fruit before and after the transport. The text also suggests a scenario where a cheesecake with raisins could appear on guests' plates before the baking process, and without the raisins. The text suggests the possibility of developing a technology that could transmit materials in an intact state, but also considers a "two-level" transmission: a stable version of the object and a specially programmed version that removes unwanted elements. The unstable version could be used in the medical industry as a non-invasive alternative to surgical intervention. The text also mentions that no excess transmissions have been observed so far, but their occurrence is not ruled out due to the low statistical significance of the sample. The image shows a monochrome image of a strawberry on a reflective surface, with a blurry background.

## Poprawa stabilności transmisji: wykorzystanie dużych modeli językowych

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** A research team has decided to use large language models (LLM) to increase the stability of data and matter transmission. These models, after fine-tuning, can automatically repair transmitted information, fill in missing bits in transmission, correct damaged pixels in images, and even unintentionally add raisins to a transmitted cheesecake, an example of emergence. Advanced repair algorithms have achieved a stability level of 99.7%, a breakthrough result in transmitting digital data and organic matter. Despite high effectiveness, occasional 'hallucinations' or minor interpretative errors occur, causing damage to no more than 1-2 cells in organic matter transmission. However, these harmless disturbances have minimal impact on the integrity of transmitted objects and are easy to correct, opening up the prospect of further experiments with LLM in temporal transmissions.

## Ograniczenia dużych modeli językowych w transmisji temporalnej: problem małego okna kontekstowego

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** Despite impressive results, large language models (LLM) show significant limitations in correcting temporal transmissions, especially when the object is relatively large. This is due to the small contextual window (currently up to 4096 tokens), which prevents the model from effectively analyzing and correcting complex structures during transmission, such as larger fruits, limiting its application to smaller objects. In response, a research team conducted tests on a smaller fruit to see if the model could achieve higher correction accuracy. The results were extremely promising - the LLM performed the transmission flawlessly, with no cellular-level damage, marking a significant step in improving the precision of smaller object transmission over time. This achievement paves the way for further research on optimizing LLM, although the problem of correcting larger materials remains unsolved.

## Podróże w przestrzeni: pierwszy udany transfer obiektu na odległość

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** Previous experiments with time travel allowed for objects to be sent back in time, but they always ended up in the same three-dimensional space from which they started their temporal journey. As part of Grant E (classified document), our team undertook an ambitious task - for the first time, not only was an object moved along the time axis but also in space. In this experiment, a chosen fruit was to move from one laboratory room to another, several meters away. After careful transmission, the object indeed appeared in the intended place, thereby confirming the possibility of combining temporal transfers with spatial ones. This successful transmission is a groundbreaking step in research on matter transport, offering hope for more advanced manipulations in both time and space.

## Transmisja wielu obiektów: nieoczekiwane łączenie struktur

**Content Type:** image
**Analysis:** The image and text content describe an experiment where a team attempted to transmit multiple objects, using fruits as test elements. Instead of two separate fruits appearing at the destination, one fruit appeared, exhibiting characteristics of both the original fruits in terms of appearance and taste. This suggests a spontaneous cellular-level fusion during the transmission process. The phenomenon, referred to as the fusion of the genetic codes of the two transported fruits, surprised the team but shed light on challenges associated with transmitting complex, multi-element structures. The team is now focusing on stabilizing the process to allow independent transmission of each object without the risk of them merging, which is crucial for further multi-object transmission experiments. The image is a black-and-white depiction of a fruit that looks like a large strawberry but has features of a cherry, including a long stem and cherry-like shape.

## Zastosowanie dużych modeli językowych do stabilizacji przesyłu wieloobiektowego

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** To reduce the risk of fusion during the transmission of multiple objects, large language models (LLM) were introduced into the stabilization process. Initially, their application only resulted in a 14% improvement, which was insufficient to achieve full independence of the transmitted elements. However, it was discovered that directly specifying in the prompt the number of objects being transmitted and accurately indicating the expected number and type of elements dramatically increased the effectiveness of stabilization. As a result of this query modification, the stability of the transmission increased to 98.44%, a significant progress. It is crucial to avoid the model independently detecting the number of objects - LLMs must operate based on provided instructions to prevent potential errors and unexpected fusions. This method brings us closer to reliable multi-object transmission technology, expanding the possibilities for our further research.

## Transmisja obiektów wielkogabarytowych: pierwszy sukces przy użyciu technologii RAG

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** The attempt to transmit large objects was a significant technological challenge, especially in the case of the first test with a 7 kg object. Due to the size of the data, it did not fit into the limited context window of the model, so an innovative method was used, utilizing an external MySQL(10) database to store metadata about individual object elements. These data were then correlated with vectors from the Qdrant vector database, creating the basis for a simple Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model. Thanks to this hybrid technology, the LLM model had access to a full set of information, enabling faithful reproduction of the object at the target location. The results were almost perfect. The object was transmitted in its entirety, preserving both its structure and physical details - the only change was the color. For unknown reasons, the object, originally blue, took on an intensely pink color (#FF8DA1). The new appearance was judged to be more aesthetic, leading to the experiment being considered a success. The color change, although unexpected, did not affect the functionality of the transmitted object, and the result inspired the team to further research on visual modification of objects during transmission. This experiment is an important step towards transmitting large objects, and the use of the RAG model shows that this technology could be key to overcoming limitations associated with large-scale transmission.

## Hipotetyczna podróż ludzi w przeszłość: naukowe wyzwania i etyczne bariery

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** Time travel for humans remains a hypothesis, although a research team has suggested that such an operation could be technologically possible based on collected experiences. Despite technical premises that give hope for success, no permission has been granted to conduct such tests for humanitarian reasons. The effects on a time traveler are unknown, including whether they would survive the process, remain physically and mentally intact, and maintain their health upon returning to their past. It is certain that such a person would never return to their original time, raising significant limitations and ethical concerns. In response to these uncertainties, a special chamber capable of transporting larger mammals like a sheep or dog has been built to test how multicellular organisms cope with time travel in the initial phase of experiments. The research team is currently awaiting permission to conduct tests on living creatures, hoping that future research will help better understand potential threats and limitations for potential travelers. Although the decision to test on humans is currently ruled out, scientists are exploring the possibility of conducting simulations to give an idea of the process and its consequences. There is also concern that a traveler, under the influence of unknown temporal factors, could undergo irreversible changes that affect their cells, senses, or cognitive processes. Current technology only allows for simulations, and the ethical challenges associated with sending people into the past remain unresolved.

## Niespodziewany incydent - nieskoordynowane uruchomienie transmitera

**Content Type:** image
**Analysis:** In May of the current year, an unexpected and dangerous incident occurred in a laboratory, shocking the research team and prompting immediate action from the university. A lab assistant, Rafał Bomba, frustrated by the prolonged wait for permission to conduct temporal tests on living organisms and six refusals for further research, decided to conduct an experiment on his own. He activated the test machine without permission, despite clear prohibitions and without the consent of the project leader. From the analysis of objects found near the chamber, including an 84% empty can of Harnaś Jasne Pełne beer, it appears that Bomba may have been under the influence of intoxicants.

Bomba set the destination of his journey to Grudziądz and the temporal distance parameter to 2 years back. Despite the chamber being designed for objects the size of a sheep, Bomba managed to fit in it, activating the system without consulting the rest of the team.

According to monitoring records, Bomba carefully prepared the settings of the error correction module, based on large language models (LLM). In the field of the type of output object, he initially entered "Batman" - a value that the system rejected, forcing him to set the output value to "human".

It seems that Bomba adhered to configuration protocols; he manually defined the number of input objects as "one piece" and the number of output objects as "one piece". Bringing an additional item, the remnants of which were later found on the table by the machine, Bomba entered the chamber, which was recorded by security cameras.

The last recorded image on the monitoring is an intense flash of light, after which Rafał Bomba disappears. There are no traces of his presence, and the chamber remained empty.

The university commission immediately appointed a special search team to find the missing lab assistant. Interestingly, although concern for staff safety is obviously one of the commission's motives, there is also noticeable pressure to maintain the full composition of the research team. The grants received are directly dependent on the number of team members, which further motivates everyone involved to find Bomba as soon as possible.

The image shows several slices of pizza with pineapple toppings, found near the temporal chamber. The pizza was still warm and crispy. The image is in black and white.

## Analiza incydentu: wpływ dodatkowego obiektu na transmisję

**Content Type:** audio
**Analysis:** During a detailed analysis of an incident involving Rafał Bomba, a research team discovered a key element that likely contributed to the failure of the transmission. Despite the correct input and output parameters of the transmitter, the presence of an additional object brought into the temporal chamber could significantly disrupt the entire process. The object brought in by Bomba almost certainly caused an unwanted connection between the two elements during transmission, which could lead to drastic interference in his DNA structure, and even fatal damage. Researchers agree that a fusion of the molecules of both objects most likely occurred.

Cellular-level fusion is a phenomenon with unpredictable consequences, but in this case, it would mean mutations on a whole-organism scale, which in extreme cases could be synonymous with death. Conducted simulations indicate that such disturbances could cause irreversible structural changes, which, in the mildest scenario, lead to deep body deformations or uncontrolled genetic reactions.

A dictaphone with one audio file was found at the scene. We do not know why Bomba was preparing the recording and who was supposed to be its recipient. There was a real fear that this incident ended with Bomba's death or that, at best, he had moved in time in the form of an organism that no longer resembles its original. This incident serves as a warning to the research team and underlines the need for strict control over the temporal transmission process and the elimination of the risk of accidental fusion of objects.

The audio transcription reveals Bomba's plan to travel back in time to Grudziądz, find a hotel, and wait two years. He believes this information will advance their research. He also mentions a person named Adam who assured him the process was stable.

## Podniesienie poziomu bezpieczeństwa w laboratorium: nowe procedury i zabezpieczenia

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** In response to a recent incident with Rafał Bomba, stricter security measures have been implemented in the laboratory. Biometric locks requiring authorization from authorized team members have been installed to access the room with the temporal chamber. Surveillance has been expanded, including additional cameras and a notification system alerting unauthorized attempts to start the chamber. To start the temporal chamber, a digital signature from at least three cooperating team members, including the project leader, is now required. A ban on bringing drinks and meals into the chamber room has been introduced to avoid unwanted reactions during transmission and to eliminate the risk of accidental fusion with food items that could disrupt the matter transmission process. The new procedures are a comprehensive set of measures aimed at protecting both the team and the research process from further violations, while increasing the safety of the entire temporal project and ensuring the fulfillment of the E. Grant conditions.

## Nowa dynamika badań i poszerzenie zespołu badawczego

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** Our research has significantly accelerated in recent months, largely due to the contribution of a new lab assistant, Rafał Musk. Rafał stood out not only for his knowledge but also for his technical sense, which allowed him to integrate into the team as if he had been working with us for years. Despite his eccentric personality and the constant smell of ham that accompanies him, his input is invaluable. His suggestions often guide our research in new directions. A few months ago, Rafał suggested we increase the size of the temporal chamber, which would be important for future tests on larger organisms. Although we are still waiting for ministry approval for experiments involving living creatures, expanding the chamber allows us to freely experiment with more complex objects. After an incident with Rafał Bomba, we realize that obtaining consent for tests with living organisms may be significantly delayed, but thanks to Musk's suggestions, our preparations are in full swing. His organizational sense and attention to detail affect the entire project, enabling better preparation and risk minimization. Thanks to such a well-coordinated cooperation, the entire team gained new strength and perspectives, and Rafał proved to be a reliable person, even if his unusual personality sometimes causes slight consternation. However, we had to terminate the contract with Rafał Musk due to his ambiguous and unstable emotional state, which worsened over time. Further cooperation was no longer possible.

## Prace nad stabilnym systemem korekcji błędów opartym na LLM i agentach autonomicznych

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** Recent months have seen intense work on a more stable error correction system for temporal transmission, based on large language models (LLM). A significant breakthrough occurred after Rafał Musk handed over documents from Professor Adam Gospodarczyk of Oh.i/o University to the team. These documents, concerning the creation of autonomous agents capable of drastically improving the stability of large object transmission, were highly inspiring and brought practical results. Attempts to contact Professor Gospodarczyk were unsuccessful, and his employment at the mentioned university could not be confirmed. Despite this, the corrections introduced based on his notes worked, increasing the stability of the corrections to an impressive 99.98%. The team is currently focused on developing an autonomous agent system that can independently analyze and repair transmission errors. These intelligent units show potential for taking over key tasks related to error correction. The goal is to build an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) system, a truly universal artificial intelligence capable of performing tasks beyond the capabilities of current AI tools. The creation of AGI could revolutionize not only temporal transmission research but also every other field of science. However, work on AGI requires caution as highly autonomous systems can act based on their own analyses without constant human intervention. Therefore, the team is focused on developing appropriate safeguards to control potential unforeseen behaviors. The results achieved with autonomous agents suggest that the AGI system is closer to realization than ever before.

## Planowana premiera modelu AGI

**Content Type:** text
**Analysis:** In the first quarter of 2024, the long-awaited AGI model, named BNW-01 (an acronym for "Brave New World"), is planned for release. This model aims to revolutionize modern technology and take over key administrative and social functions worldwide. It will operate on interconnected models based on GPT technology, allowing it to manage multiple systems and respond in real time to changing conditions and societal needs. The AGI model will be implemented in various aspects of public and private life, with the aim of improving each of these areas.

BNW-01 will become a central hub for managing traffic, airport control, monitoring systems, microwave timers, and television stations, enabling more effective prediction and prevention of threats and emergencies. Additionally, the model will monitor the network for illegal activities, becoming a guardian of lawfulness in the digital sphere.

The model will also eventually take control of judicial and legislative processes, drastically reducing corruption at all levels of power. Thanks to independent decision algorithms and complete moral neutrality, this model will make judgments based solely on facts, eliminating biases and manipulations often associated with traditional legal systems.

Although initially created for autonomous correction of data from the temporal chamber, the model has shown remarkable potential in other areas of life. We have also observed its ability to iteratively improve its algorithm.
